## Seasonality
**R** script files to assess seasonality and the role of its potential drivers in environmental epidemiology studies.

* **examples.R** reproduces the examples from the published manistucrip. 
* It is necessary to upload the following ancillary functions: 
    * **cyclic.R** function to generate the clyclic spline (adapted from the R packge DLNM by <a href="" target="_blank">Gasparrini 2017</a>).  
    * **findmax.R** function to generate the clyclic spline (adapted from the R packge DLNM by <a href="" target="_blank">Gasparrini 2017</a>).  . 
    * **findmin.R** function to generate the clyclic spline (adapted from the R packge DLNM by <a href="" target="_blank">Gasparrini 2017</a>).  . 
    * **attrs.R** function to generate the clyclic spline (adapted from the R packge DLNM by <a href="" target="_blank">Gasparrini 2017</a>).  .
